--== The Canonical Source for TADS/2 ==--

Here it is. Just what you've been waiting for: the source code to
TADS/2.

It's not pretty. In fact, it goes somewhere beyond ugly to
hide-the-children-flee-in-terror-hideousness. For one thing, the
organization of the files is rather...creative. For another thing,
I hacked this port together using Andrew Plotkin's MaxTADS display
code (for the Macintosh), my small knowledge of OS/2 GUI programming,
and EMX GCC. Frankenstein's monster had a less-checkered creation.
You could probably get this working under a nice IDE compiler, but I
haven't tried. Good luck; let me know if you try and are successful.

Theoretically, if you have EMX GCC, you can unzip the folder into its
own directory (make sure to keep the htads and ctads folders as-is),
then run make using the included makefile, and all will come up roses.
I wouldn't bet heavily on it.

Here's how things are organized. The htads folder holds all the
base TADS .h files. The ctads folder contains the base TADS .c files.
All the files in the root directory of the archive are of my own
creation. My files work as a sort of wrapper: they fool the base TADS
code into thinking that it's running in an uncomplicated text
window. My files implement Andrew's screen code, the OS/2-native stuff,
binding files into executables, accessing the clipboard, etc. ad
nauseum, to add a little Latin.

If you do decide to do anything with this code, feel free to drop me a
line. I don't promise to remember anything about this code, or about
OS/2 programming in general, but I'll be happy to chat with you. I
would like to know if you use this code in another project, or if you
decide to update TADS/2.

That's it. Enjoy.
