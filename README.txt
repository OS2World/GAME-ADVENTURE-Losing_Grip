Remember the days of Infocom text-adventure games?  Ever wonder, "Does
anyone still make those games?"

Yes, they do.  _Losing Your Grip_ is a piece of interactive fiction (aka a
text adventure) written using TADS, the Text Adventure Development System, by
Michael J. Roberts.

If you have played text adventures before, you shouldn't have any problems
with _Losing Your Grip_. It will understand commands like:

  look
  go west (can be abbreviated as "w")
  open drawer
  unlock door with key
  open it (would refer to the door above)
  pour liquid on umbrella
  type "foo" on keyboard

If you haven't played such games before, you would do well to read grip.doc for information.

Some shorthand commands that might be useful are:

  x - examine
  l - look
  i - inventory (list everything you are carrying)
  g - again (redo last command)
  z - wait (do nothing for one minute)
  n, w, s, e, nw, sw, se, ne, u, d - move in different directions

For more information, please type "about" while playing _Losing Your Grip_ or
visit my web page at http://www.phy.duke.edu/~sgranade/lyg.html.

The game is no longer shareware -- I have released it freely. 

You can get the old registration files, including a registration key that unlocks the hints, from 
http://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/tads/gripfeelies.zip, or if they'd 
prefer actual printed manuals, they can order them from
http://feelies.org/game.php?id=3 for only $5.
