I am providing the code to Losing Your Grip in the hopes that it might
be useful to those who are writing TADS games. This is not the neatest
code in the world. This is a huge, sprawling game; the code mirrors
the game structure.

You may take this code, modify it, and use it in your own projects
as you see fit, so long as you do not a) create a new version of Losing
Your Grip itself and distribute it, or b) distribute a version of Losing
Your Grip which does not have my name on it.

As a matter of courtesy, if you do use my code, I ask that you e-mail
me at sgranade@phy.duke.edu and let me know. If you want to credit me
somewhere within your own game, so much the better.

I have left the game registration code as-is. I'm not taking
registrations any more, so there's no sense in hiding it. Its encryption
method is far from top-secret. I offer it here for historical purposes.
If you're compiling the game yourself but want the hints automatically
enabled, you can modify the gameinit function in gripstd.t to do
so. Take the part that reads "if (kprime == k && ..." and replace
what's inside the parentheses with the word "true".
